Throw everything you've heard out the window, folks. With more than a year of net baby time now under their belts, our experts have worked tirelessly to produce a definitive guide to answering the eternal question: what the !@#$ does my baby want?

Have you heard of those "woke" parents who are using gender-neutral pronouns for their kids until they can choose their gender? They clearly haven't seen a boy and girl baby side by side. They are wildly different beasts. If you're not factoring in what they have between their legs to figuring out what the hell they want, you're playing with one hand tied behind your back. 

Little boy babies are easy to read. They only ever want four things. Whenever lil' buddy's crying, just go through our patented four-step process (IE, just try each one of those things) until you find one that makes him stop crying.

### 1) Food
Grab a bottle, or if you're one of those all-natural types (or your wife is in the room), just hand him to mommy. If he starts sucking, ding ding ding, we have a winner. If not, go to step 2.

### 2) Burp
Dude may have gone a little wild with the binge-eating. Sometimes they have a pretty gnarly gas buildup in there. Make sure to take off your expensive cardigan, then prop lil' buddy up over your shoulder and start pounding away. Little boy babies are fairly robust, so you can get him pretty hard without pissing him off. Give it twenty seconds or so, and if he doesn't let out a window-rattler or cover your back with cottage-cheese looking stuff, move on to step 3.

### 3) Entertainment
Lil' buddy didn't come into this world just to be mesmerized by the ceiling! Sometimes he needs some action in his young life. So pick that guy up, turn him around to take on the world head-on, and take him exploring around the house. The one-arm-tuck-underneath-the-crotch technique works pretty well until he gets to around 15-20 pounds, and then you'll probably need to work in that other hand. Regardless, make sure to switch it up so you don't get those gains on only one side. If he was just bored, he'll stop crying right away once you start moving around. Otherwise, move on to step 4.

### 4) Sleep
You've tried everything else. Lil' buddy must just need a nap. Plop that guy down in his crib. He'll probably look up at you thinking it's play time, and then get really sad when you leave. Now comes the hard part: **you have to let him cry**. Even if he's not so tired, he'll wear himself out screaming for five minutes or so and then slowly wind down to a whimper before going down for the count. If he screams for more than five minutes without any signs of letting up, call your wife because you can't figure out what's wrong with him.

Figuring out little girl babies, on the other hand, is like trying to solve a rubik's cube one-handed and blindfolded while simultaneously playing X-Box and trying to fully comprehend what your wife is telling you about the chores you have to do on Sunday. 

Our test subject in this study has demonstrated signs of a continuously-shifting personality between "cooperative" and "defiant" states, seemingly at random, but typically when you need her to hold still or just eat the stupid baby oatmeal. During one period of observation, lil' budette, despite being clearly hungry, refused to even open her mouth for anything that wasn't a [Bamba](https://www.osem.co.il/en/product/classic-bamba/) or attached to her mom. So, while the same basic needs apply, figuring out what's bugging her takes a far greater amount of determination and patience. Take a deep breath, dad.
